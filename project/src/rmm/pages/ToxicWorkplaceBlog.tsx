            <h2>üí¨ Real Stories, Real Change</h2>

            <p><em>üí° Fact: <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/research/culture-salary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 font-semibold hover:underline" > Glassdoor research </a>{' '} shows that 56% of employees say a strong workplace culture is more important than salary when it comes to job satisfaction. </em> </p>

  
            <h2>üß≠ Conclusion: Your Voice Matters</h2>
            <p>You don‚Äôt have to tolerate toxicity. Whether you choose to speak up, move on, or help build something better, your experience is valid and powerful.</p>
  
            <p>By identifying toxic patterns, protecting your mental health, and raising your voice, you contribute to a movement toward workplace transparency and reform.</p>
